      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Spatial frequency refers to the level of detail or complexity in an image. It is a measure of how rapidly the brightness or color changes across an image. High spatial frequencies correspond to fine details and sharp edges, while low spatial frequencies represent smooth gradients and overall shapes.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why is Spatial Frequency Important?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Spatial frequency plays a crucial role in various aspects of our lives:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
        <li>Visual Perception: Our visual system processes spatial frequencies to perceive and recognize objects, faces, and scenes.</li>
        <li>Image Compression: Spatial frequency information is used to efficiently compress images and videos for storage and transmission.</li>
        <li>Computer Vision: Algorithms analyze spatial frequencies to detect edges, textures, and patterns in images for tasks like object recognition and segmentation.</li>
        <li>Medical Imaging: Spatial frequency analysis helps in extracting valuable diagnostic information from medical images like X-rays and MRIs.</li>
