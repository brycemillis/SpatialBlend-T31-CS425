        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project aims to develop a web application using Python and Tailwind CSS, allowing users to upload, manipulate, and merge images. The application will provide tools for altering spatial frequencies of images and creating composite images from multiple uploads.</p>
        <p>The application will serve as an interactive learning platform, focusing on spatial frequency manipulation, continuous image variation, and frequency-dependent color changes. It aims to fill the gap in the availability of educational and interactive tools in the field of image processing and visual perception.</p>
        <p>The primary audience for this application includes students and educators. Students will find interactive tools and educational content that help them practically understand theoretical concepts in image processing. Educators can use the application as an interactive teaching aid for image manipulation concepts, fostering student engagement with real-time demonstrations.</p>
        <p>The application will offer real-time image upload, manipulation, and download capabilities. It will provide tools for spatial frequency alteration and frequency-dependent color changes. The application aims to deliver a seamless, intuitive user experience, with a simple and modern UI developed using Tailwind CSS.</p>
        <p>Educational content will be embedded within the app to facilitate learning. Users will also have the option to create an account and save their images on the application. This project not only caters to practical image manipulation needs but also serves as an educational resource for understanding image processing, frequency analysis, and basic human vision.</p>
